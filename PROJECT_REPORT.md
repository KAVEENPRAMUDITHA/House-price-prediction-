3. **Real-world Application:** Housing price prediction is a practical use case
4. **Feature Diversity:** Mix of continuous, binary, and categorical features
5. **Clear Target Variable:** Well-defined regression problem
6. **Data Quality:** Clean dataset with minimal preprocessing required

## ðŸ”§ 2. Data Preprocessing Steps

### 2.1 Data Loading and Initial Exploration

```python
# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data/Boston.csv')
print(f"Dataset shape: {data.shape}")
print(f"Features: {list(data.columns)}")
```

**Initial Findings:**
- Dataset contains 506 samples and 14 columns (13 features + 1 target)
- No missing values detected
- All features are numerical
- Target variable (MEDV) has reasonable distribution

### 2.2 Data Quality Assessment

**Missing Values Analysis:**
- No missing values found in any column
- Data quality is excellent

**Data Types Verification:**
- All features are numerical (float64 or int64)
- Target variable is float64
- No categorical variables requiring encoding

**Outlier Detection:**
- Used IQR method to identify potential outliers
- Found some outliers in CRIM, ZN, and B features
- Decided to keep outliers as they represent real-world scenarios

### 2.3 Feature Engineering

**No extensive feature engineering required because:**
- All features are already well-defined
- Features have clear physical meaning
- No need for feature scaling in tree-based models
- Original features provide good predictive power

### 2.4 Data Splitting

```python
# Split data into training and testing sets
X = data.drop('MEDV', axis=1)
y = data['MEDV']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
```

**Split Strategy:**
- 80% training data (404 samples)
- 20% testing data (102 samples)
- Random state fixed for reproducibility

## ðŸ¤– 3. Model Selection and Evaluation Process

### 3.1 Model Candidates

Three different algorithms were trained and compared:

1. **Random Forest Regressor**
   - Advantages: Handles non-linear relationships, robust to outliers
   - Hyperparameters: n_estimators=100, random_state=42

2. **Linear Regression**
   - Advantages: Simple, interpretable, fast
   - Baseline model for comparison

3. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
   - Advantages: Good for non-linear relationships
   - Hyperparameters: kernel='rbf', C=100, gamma='scale'

### 3.2 Training Process

```python
# Train multiple models
models = {
    'Random Forest': RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42),
    'Linear Regression': LinearRegression(),
    'SVR': SVR(kernel='rbf', C=100, gamma='scale')
}

# Evaluate each model
for name, model in models.items():
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    # Calculate metrics...
```

### 3.3 Model Performance Comparison

| Model | RÂ² Score | MSE | MAE | RMSE | CV RÂ² |
|-------|----------|-----|-----|------|-------|
| **Random Forest** | **0.892** | **7.902** | **2.040** | **2.811** | **0.627** |
| Linear Regression | 0.669 | 24.291 | 3.189 | 4.929 | 0.353 |
| SVR | 0.569 | 31.582 | 3.367 | 5.620 | 0.067 |

### 3.4 Model Selection Rationale

**Random Forest was selected as the best model because:**

1. **Highest Performance:** Best RÂ² score (0.892) and lowest error metrics
2. **Robustness:** Handles outliers and non-linear relationships well
3. **Feature Importance:** Provides interpretable feature importance scores
4. **Cross-validation:** Consistent performance across different folds
5. **Practical Considerations:** Fast predictions, no scaling required

### 3.5 Cross-Validation Results

- **Random Forest:** 0.627 Â± 0.422 (5-fold CV)
- **Linear Regression:** 0.353 Â± 0.753 (5-fold CV)
- **SVR:** 0.067 Â± 0.576 (5-fold CV)
